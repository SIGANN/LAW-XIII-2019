should be submitted as short papers (up to 4 pages). The program will include a
panel discussion of potential shared tasks.</b></p>


<h2>Submissions and Reviewing</h2>

<p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of
interest to the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the
workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should
emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate
clearly the state of completion of the reported results.</p>


<p>A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>


<p>The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers and four (4)
pages of content for short papers, posters, and demonstrations. References do
not count toward the page limit.</p>


<p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not
include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the
authorsâ€™ identity--e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should be
replaced with citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers
that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.</p>


<p>Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs
(<a href="mailto:law-xi-2017-chairs@googlegroups.com">law-xi-2017-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>). Authors
of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance
if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>

<p>More precise intructions on submission, including style files and submission
web site, will be posted later.</p>
  
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program co-chairs.</p>
