	<h1>Workshop Description</h1>
      
	<p>Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of
	  supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It
	  also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and
	  supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic
	  phenomena.</p>

	<p>The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of
	  innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including
	  creation and evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic
	  and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and
	  frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations,
	  etc. </p>

	<p>LAW XI is the annual workshop for the <xb>ACL Special Interest Group
	  on Annotation
	  (<a href="http://www.cs.vassar.edu/sigann/">SIGANN</a>)</b>.</p>

	<h2>Special Theme: Marking of information quality in discourse</h2>
	<p>We encourage submission of papers relating to this year's special theme: <strong>marking of information quality in discourse</strong>, i.e., annotations that mark how the speaker/writer expresses assessments. These assessments may be explicit and/or implicit in discourse, and may reflect positions, beliefs, opinions, appraisals and/or assessments about written or spoken propositions, for example, how a politician shows in discourse the degree of truthfulness in one of his/her electoral promises, or how a reporter shows his/her degree of belief in what the politician stated. This might include the annotation of devices such as hedges (“Donald claims that the crowd size, if you can really trust him to measure it, was enormous.”), committed belief (“The winners of the contest will be announced tomorrow.“) or attitudes (“It is with great sadness that we have learnt about the death of 6 people in the accident.”).</p>
