	<h1>Workshop Description</h1>
      
	<p>Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of
	  supervised methods for statistical natural language processing. It
	  also provides valuable data for evaluation of both rule-based and
	  supervised systems and can help formalize and study linguistic
	  phenomena.</p>

	<p>The LAW provides a forum for presentation and discussion of
	  innovative research on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including
	  creation and evaluation of annotation schemes, methods for automatic
	  and manual annotation, use and evaluation of annotation software and
	  frameworks, representation of linguistic data and annotations,
	  etc. </p>

	<p>LAW XI is the annual workshop for the <xb>ACL Special Interest Group
	  on Annotation
	  (<a href="http://www.cs.vassar.edu/sigann/">SIGANN</a>)</b>, in 2017
	  it is co-located with
