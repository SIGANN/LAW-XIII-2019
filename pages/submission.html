<h1>Submission</h1>

<h2>Electronic submission</h2>

<p>
Submission is electronic, using the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/eacl2017/law/user/scmd.cgi?scmd=submitPaperCustom&pageid=0" class="normalLink">Softconf START conference management system</a>.
</p>


<h2>Submission and Reviewing</h2>

<p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.</p>

<p>A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>


<h2>Format</h2>

<p>The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers and four (4) pages of content for short papers, plus up to two (2) pages of references.
At the workshop, papers will be presented as oral presentations, posters or systems demonstrations.
</p>

<p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authorsâ€™ identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should be replaced with citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.
Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (<a href="mailto:law-xi-2017-chairs@googlegroups.com">law-xi-2017-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>). Authors. Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>

<p>
Submissions must be in PDF format and must use the <a class="normalLink" href="http://acl2016.org/index.php?article_id=9">ACL 2016 style files</a>.</p>
-->

<p>Submissions must be in the PDF format and must follow the EACL 2017 guidelines. From the EACL 2017 website:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Submissions must be in PDF, and must conform to the official style
guidelines for EACL 2017. We ask you to use the
<a href="http://eacl2017.org/images/site/eacl-2017-template.zip"</a>EACL-2017 LaTeX template</a>

<p>These are available on the conference website. We reserve the right to
reject submissions if the paper does not conform to these styles, including
letter size and font size restrictions. We have made the decision to enforce
latex style files and submission of both latex source and PDF for final
papers for the following reasons:</p>

<p>Latex ensures a uniform machine readable format for the
<a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology"/>ACL Anthology</a>, which also benefits the use of the
anthology as a corpus; most formatting issues in previous conferences were
caused by papers that did not conform to the latex style files ; Latex
supports uniform and consistent references, authors are encouraged to use
the bibtex entries provided by the ACL anthology. To facilitate
collaboration and ease the burden on authors not familiar with latex, we
have made available a
<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/publication-template-for-eacl-2017-proceedings/jnphvwsdkvvk#.V6b-v5OAOko%27%3Etemplate">template on Overleaf</a>
that you and your colleagues can use to author the paper, produce the
corresponding latex source files and convert the paper to pdf.

</blockquote>

<p>Release of associated data/software is encouraged, and plans for such a release should be noted in the submission form and (anonymously) in the paper itself.</p>

<!--
<p>LAW-X encourages the submission of supplementary material, e.g., data sets or software.
Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material. Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material in the paper submission, so that reviewers interested in these supplementary details will know where to look.
</p>

<h2>Final submission (camera ready versions of accepted papers)</h2>

<p>For your final paper submissions, again use the style and format as required
by EACL 2017, and when converting to PDF, make sure that the fonts are
embedded.</p>

<p>We allow one additional page to address reviewers' comments. Long paper
submissions must follow the two-column format of the EACL 2017 proceedings
without exceeding nine (9) pages of content. References do not count against
this limit. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of
the EACL 2017 proceedings, and must not exceed five (5) pages. References do not
count against this limit.</p>
